IGC-FTP Uploader requires that an empty temporary table be available in the database, for the IGC Daily Indicators (GOI and Sub-Indices).

The queries are as follows:
---------------------------

CREATE TABLE igc_daily_indicators_temp AS
  SELECT * FROM AMIS_IGC_DAILY_MARKET_MONITOR_INDICATORS_b65370f1;


THEN delete Rows:
  DELETE FROM igc_daily_indicators_temp;
